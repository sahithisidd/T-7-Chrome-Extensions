# Browser Extension Security Analysis 

##  Overview
This project focuses on identifying and evaluating the security risks of installed browser extensions.  
Browser extensions can make life easier from blocking ads to improving productivity but they can also be a gateway for security threats like phishing, data theft, or malicious tracking.  

This report documents the step-by-step process of reviewing installed extensions, checking their legitimacy, and identifying any that might be suspicious or unsafe.

##  Objective
- Review all installed browser extensions.
- Identify and flag suspicious or malicious extensions.
- Verify that only trusted and necessary extensions remain installed.
